## Version 0.5.1
* bugfix

## Version 0.5.2

## Version 0.5.4
* Major performance improvements, specifically with traversing filestructures
* Better exception handling
* When the api rate limit is reached, the program will always retry at an increased timeout
* Multi-threaded folder traversing

* Better interrupt handling
* Better decoding of filenames and convert names with disallowed characters to proper os format
* Removed bug where some files would get copied twice
* File copies are now retried
